# Welcome to VoidLayer9

**VoidLayer9** is a GitHub organization dedicated to defining the future of **vibecoding** — a movement where intent and aesthetic precision drive software creation. We build templates, standards, and tools designed for an LLM-driven development era.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that **vibecoding** bridges the gap between imagination and execution. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and focused, minimalist architectures, we empower everyone — regardless of technical background — to build incredible, high-performance tools.

Our mission is to prove that you don't need decades of experience to create software that feels premium, robust, and alive. You just need the right vibe.

## Projects

Our ecosystem is built on the principles of simplicity, single-file architectures, and zero-dependency design.

### [VibeLog](https://github.com/VoidLayer9/VibeLog)

> *A minimalist, industrial-aesthetic blog engine.*

- **Built on Cortex**: Runs on our custom C sandbox.
- **Single-File Architecture**: Everything lives in one file.
- **No SQL**: Uses a structured JSON file system.
- **Dynamic**: Real-time metrics and a brutalist design.

### [Cortex](https://github.com/VoidLayer9/Cortex)

> *The engine of vibecoding.*

- **LLM-First Sandbox**: A C environment designed for AI reasoning.
- **Zero-Dependency**: No external runtime requirements.
- **Multi-Target**: Compiles to Linux, Windows, .deb, .rpm, and more.
- **Embedded Assets**: Self-contained binaries with compiled-in static files.

## Get Involved

We are building the standards for the next generation of software creators. Whether you're a prompt engineer, a C developer, or a visionary with an idea, VoidLayer9 provides the foundation.
